# Tabula – Your Space, No Noise

Tabula replaces the browser new tab with an elegant "clock of clocks" experience that stays out of the way while keeping time, quick access, and personalization within immediate reach.

## Highlights at a Glance
- **Clock-first design:** A modular analog/digital hybrid clock rendered entirely in TypeScript and CSS for crisp timing cues.
- **Instant personalization:** Theme presets, palette overrides, pinned shortcuts, search bar placement, and clock styling—saved instantly via browser storage.
- **Responsive and reliable:** Built with Vite + TypeScript + Vitest, ensuring fast iteration, extensible architecture, and test-backed stability.
